        "N50 refers to the median contig length of a genome assembly, where contigs are contiguous sequences of DNA. It is a measure of the quality of the assembly, with higher N50 values indicating longer contigs and a more complete assembly.\n",
        "\n",
        "L50, on the other hand, refers to the number of contigs that make up the N50 value. In other words, it is the number of contigs that are at least as long as the N50 value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, N50 and L50 provide a way to evaluate the quality and completeness of a genome assembly. A higher N50 value and a lower L50 value generally indicate a better assembly."
